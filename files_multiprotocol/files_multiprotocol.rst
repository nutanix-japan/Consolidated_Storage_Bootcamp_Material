Multi-protocol
++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will configure an existing SMB share to also support NFS. Enabling multi-protocol access requires you to configure user mappings and define the native and non-native protocol for a share.

Configure User Mappings
.......................

A Nutanix Files share has the concept of a native and non-native protocol.  All permissions are applied using the native protocol.
Any access requests using the non-native protocol requires a user or group mapping to the permission applied from the native side.
There are several ways to apply user and group mappings including rule based, explicit and default mappings.  You will first configure a default mapping.

#. In **Prism Element > File Server**, select your file server and click **Launch Files Console**.

#. The **Files Console** will open in a new browser tab

#. Click on **Configuration > Authentication**

#. Select the **User Mapping** tab

#. In the **Default Mapping** click on **Edit** 

   .. figure:: images/52.png

#. From the **Default Mapping** page choose both **Deny access to NFS export** and **Deny access to SMB share** as the defaults for when no mapping is found.

   .. figure:: images/52a.png

#. Complete the initial mapping by clicking on **Save**

#. In your BootcampFS' Files Console, click on **Shares** > *Initials*-Marketing share

#. Click on three dots on the right hand corner of the *Initials*-Marketing share and select **Edit**

#. From the **Update Share** page check the box at the bottom which says **Enable multiprotocol access for NFS**.

   .. figure:: images/55.png

#. Click **Next** then from the **Settings** page check **Allow Simultaneous access to the same files from both protocols**.

   .. figure:: images/56.png

#. Click **Next** and then **Update** from the **Summary** page.

This concludes the multiprotocol configuration for your *Initials*-Marketing share

Now we will try accessing the share to test multiprotocol configuration

You will use a Linux Tools VM as a client for your NFS Files export.

.. note:: If you haven't created a Linux Tools VM  as part of another lab, you may use these instructions here :ref:`linux_tools_vm` to create one. 

#. Note the IP address of the VM in Prism, and connect via SSH using the following credentials:

   - **Username** - root
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

#. Execute the following:

     .. code-block:: bash

       [root@CentOS ~]# mkdir /filesmulti
       [root@CentOS ~]# mount.nfs4 BootcampFS.ntnxlab.local:/Intials-Marketing /filesmulti
       [root@CentOS ~]# dir /filesmulti
       dir: cannot open directory /filesmulti: Permission denied
       [root@CentOS ~]#

   .. note:: The mount operation is case sensitive.

Because the default mapping is to deny access the Permission denied error is expected.  You will now add an explicit mapping to allow access to the non-native NFS protocol user.
We will need to get the user ID (UID) to create the explicit mapping.

#. Execute the following command and take note of the UID:

     .. code-block:: bash

       [root@CentOS ~]# id
       uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
       [root@CentOS ~]#

#. In **Prism Element > File Server**, select your file server (*Initials*-Marketing)and click **Launch Files Console**.

#. The **Files Console** for your share will open in a new browser tab

#. Click on **Configuration > Authentication**

#. Select the **User Mapping** tab

#. Click on **Configure** on the **Explicit Mapping** pop out

#. Click on **+ Add Manually**

#. Click **+ Add one-to-one mapping**

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **SMB Name** - ntnxlab\\administrator
   - **NFS ID** - UID from previous step (0 if root)
   - **User/Group** - User

#. Click on the "âˆš" mark to save the mapping 

   .. figure:: images/57.png

#. Click on **Save** in the **Explicit Mapping** pop out

#. Click **Close** if any pop-ups are left

#. Go back to your Linux Tools VM and execute the following:

     .. code-block:: bash

       [root@CentOS ~]# dir /filesmulti
       MyMovie.flv Sample\ Data
       [root@CentOS ~]#

You have been able to successfully configure multiprotocol access for your *Initials*-Marketing share
