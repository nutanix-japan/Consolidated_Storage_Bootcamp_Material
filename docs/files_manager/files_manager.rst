Files: Files Manager
---------------------

Smart DR feature for Files share replication is activated and maintained in Prism Central using Files Manager. In this section we will configure Smart DR requirements in Prism Central.

The Files Manager lets you view and control all of your file servers from a single control plane. Clicking a file server directs you to Nutanix Files in Prism Element (PE) where you can manage the shares, exports, and configurations of the file server. File server alerts for all registered file servers appear in a single pane for consolidated viewing, as do file server events.

The Files Manager provides the Smart DR service for Nutanix Files, which lets you protect file servers at the share-level.
