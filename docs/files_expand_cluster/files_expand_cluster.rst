Files: Expand Cluster
------------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

 This lab can only be done on a HPOC with more than 1 node. Single Node HPOC clusters cannot be used to run this lab.

 Note that the number of Files Server VMs is limited to number of physical nodes in a Nutanix cluster. Most HPOCs will have 3 to 4 nodes. 

 At the time of Files Server 4.0.0.2 release, a Files Server with just 1 FSVM cannot be scaled out. 

Files offers the ability to scale up and scale out a deployment. Scaling up the CPU and memory of Files VMs allows an environment to support higher storage throughput and number of concurrent sessions. Currently, Files VMs can be scaled up to a maximum of 12 vCPU and 96GB of RAM each.

The true power of Files scalability is the ability to simply add more Files VMs, scaling out much like the underlying Nutanix distributed storage fabric. An individual Files cluster can scale out up to the number of physical nodes in the Nutanix cluster, ensuring that no more than 1 Files VM runs on a single node during normal operation.

In this exercise we will scale out the **Intials-Files** Files Server (e.g. XYZ-Files) server we deployed in optional lab :ref:`files_deploy`

Expanding a Files Cluster
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Return to **Prism > File Server** and select your **Intials-Files** Files Server (e.g. xyz-Files).

#. Click **Update > Scale in/out FSVMs**.

#. Increment the number of Files VMs from 3 to 4 and click **Next**.

   .. figure:: images/26.png

   Note that an additional IP will be consumed for both the client and storage networks to support the added Files VM.

#. Click **Next > Save**.

   The cluster will now deploy and power on a 4th Files VM. Status can be monitored in **Prism > Tasks**.

   .. note::

     Files cluster expansion should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

   Following the expansion, verify client connections can now be load balanced to the new VM.

#. Connect to your *Initials*\ **-ToolsVM** via RDP or console.

#. Open **Control Panel > Administrative Tools > DNS**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **OK**:

   - Select **The following computer**
   - Specify **dc.ntnxlab.local**
   - Select **Connect to the specified computer now**

   .. figure:: images/28.png

#. Open **DC.ntnxlab.local > Forward Lookup Zones > ntnxlab.local** and verify there are now four entries for **BootcampFS**. Files leverages round robin DNS to load balance connections across Files VMs.

   .. note::

     If only three entries are present, you can automatically update DNS entries from **Prism > File Server** by selecting your Files cluster and clicking **DNS**.
