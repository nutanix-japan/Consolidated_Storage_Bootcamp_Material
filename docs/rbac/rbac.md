12. Go back to **user01@ntnxlab.local**'s Prism Central, refresh the page.

13. Now go to **Objects**, you can see the **Create Object Store** button is appeared again.

14. Now go to **Files**, you will only see **FS*xyz*-*a*-prod** in File Server, but you do not have right to launch the File Console.

    !!!Tip
            The launch PE console from PC and then launching File server page is permitted for Super Admin, Cluster Admin and user who has Prism Admin and Files Admin role 

## Takeaway

By using role base access control, administrator can manage user access to Files and Objects, control access right according to File Server and Object Store with very granular control of the access right.
