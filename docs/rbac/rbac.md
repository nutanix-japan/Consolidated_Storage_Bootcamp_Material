# Role Base Access Control for NUS

## Overview

Cluster role-based access control (RBAC) feature enables a super-admin user to define different access right to Nutanix Files and Objects in Prism Central. Admin can choose default or customized role to assign to users to provide admin or view access to a particular Files or Objects entity. The access right can be assigned to File Server or Object Store level so different user can manage different FS or OSS according to the management requirement.
